Hello! I am a web developer and a student based in Helsinki. 
My passion for coding drives me to create innovative websites. 
I find GitHub incredibly user-friendly and efficient for managing code repositories all in one place. 
JavaScript is my primary programming language, and I have a deep fondness for Python as well. 
My ultimate goal in coding is to automate processes and simplify the world, making life a bit easier one line of code at a time!

I'm Vlad. I am a freelancer, full stack developer. I live in Helsinki. I specialize in responsive website design using JavaScript, HTML & CSS, and building up API servers including databases using Node.js, Python, PHP.
I began my web development journey  as a self-taught developer 2 years ago. After moving from Russia to Finland, I officially started studying web development at Omnia. Now, I have skills to solve human problems in web development. If you are someone who needs to bring your ideas to life, let's chat!
